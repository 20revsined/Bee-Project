This project takes in 3 different txt files, and returns the number of moves that it took for 15 bees to travel to a beehive.
The beehive is a set of 15 open units in a 3 dimensional plane.
The program uses a custom algorithm to figure out the number of moves it takes for the bees to reach the beehive.
Each txt file contains the size of the beehive, the starting coordinates of the bees, and the location of the beehive.
The output of the program displays the starting locations of the bees, the location of the beehive, the number of moves it took for each
bee to reach the hive, and the total number of moves that it took for all 15 bees to reach the hive.
